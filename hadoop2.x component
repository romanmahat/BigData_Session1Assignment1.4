The following are the hadoop2.x  core component which include

       a)HDFS(Hadoop distrubuted file system)
       b)Yarn(yet another resourse nigotiator)

      Apache Hadoop 2. consists of the following daemons:

        a)Name Node
        b)Secondary Name Node
        c)Data Node
        d)Resource Manager
        e)Node Manager
All these Daemons are nothing but a piece of code. Java code is running at the background.
In order to run Java Code, we need JVM, So each daemon service need some JVM service to run.

Among above daemons namenode,datenode amd secondary namenode are the HDFS component.which is a storage system
and resource manager and node manager are the yarn component.which is processing system
